# Personal Website

This is the repository that contains my personal website, blog, and various other server-side tools I will one day deploy on my website (such as a url proxy, etc,.) after I can afford hosting.

 - `/link`: Contains the source code for my url proxying server side application
 - `/resume` Contains the build files for my [resume](resume.pdf)
 - `/blogs` Contains my written blogs
